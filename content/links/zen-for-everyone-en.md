There is a [PEP-0020][], recommended for every beginners learning the Python right after they learned a [PEP-0008][]. This is a set of rules to follow programming in Python (and not only in Python). These rules were written by Tim Peters and they are available right in the python interpreter. Just do the `import this`.

Today I want to give you a link to [extension of the PEP-0020][example], written by Hunter Blanks. It is a concise illustration of every item of "The Zen of Python".
