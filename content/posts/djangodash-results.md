Description: About django contest's results and my new django application.

[DjangoDash][] is over. Many lines of code were written and many deleted, but I'm sure, that all participants have got some lessons from this event. Rapid development, testing, deployment. Working under hard time limits, etc..

I've done almost all items from my TODO list, and a new django application was born this weekend â€” [django-antichaos][]. It's only  target is to simplify tag cloud editing. I have an old blog about photography, and it's tag cloud huge and messy after few years. The [django-antichaos][] tries to solve this problem. It is an instrument to merge and rename tags easily, using Drag&amp;Drop.

To show abilities of this reusable application, I've captured this short screen cast. Please, take a look, and you don't regret:

<object width="450" height="370"><param name="video" value="http://flv.video.yandex.ru/lite/alexander-artemenko/dpzwddd9rm.709/"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="scale" value="noscale"></param><embed src="http://flv.video.yandex.ru/lite/alexander-artemenko/dpzwddd9rm.709/" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="450" height="370" allowFullScreen="true" scale="noscale" ></embed></object>

As it was said, [django-antichaos][] is reusable. This means, that it can be used in any project, which uses [django-tagging][] or [django-tagging-ng][]. All sources are available at GitHub. Fork it, play with it, send patches back or make donations!

I think, that [DjangoDash][] allows us to acquire new experience and skills, furthermore, it is very funny event with some competition elements!
