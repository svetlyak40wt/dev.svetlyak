Today I released a small tool, useful for all GitHub users. This project's name is [Forkfeed][]. It's target is to watch how your projects' forks are evolved on GitHub.

Sometimes somebody forks your project and begins to improve it. But not many people send pull requests. It is hard to track all new forks. That is because I wrote a script which inspects each of your projects at Github and creates an Atom feed for all new commits. My own [feed][feed] updated daily at a VPS. Now I will be well-informed about all new forks and all new commits in them.
