Description: I started a mini game to improve our web experience.

I'm tired with IT blogs, which do not have a [CSS stylesheets for printer][lapart-printercss].

Have you ever tried to print an article from your (or anyone else's) blog? If an owner of the resource has not bothered about his/her readers, than all what you'll see on the print is one or two sidebars with an advertising from google's adsense and narrow text column in the middle.

To make this world better, lets start the game "Good, Bad & Ugly"! Here is the rules:

1. Open your RSS reader.
2. Randomly select 10 blogs.
3. Go to each of these sites and try to preview it's articles as you do before printing.
4. If page does't look well, write to blog's author about it and advice him to improve his blog with a CSS stylesheet for printer. And don't forget to send him a link to this post! :-)
5. Write in you blog about this game and apply the full list of checked blogs with marks: GOOD, BAD and UGLY.

Here is my own check list:

* [Agile Testing](http://agiletesting.blogspot.com) — <strike>BAD</strike> GOOD
* [Code monk](http://drj11.wordpress.com) — UGLY
* [Deepen C++](http://deepencpp.blogspot.com) — BAD
* [Git ready](http://gitready.com/) — GOOD
* [Irrational Exuberance](http://lethain.com) — <strike>BAD</strike> GOOD
* [JJinuxLand](http://jjinux.blogspot.com/) — UGLY
* [Justin Lilly](http://justinlilly.com) — BAD
* [MySQL Performance Blog](http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com) — BAD
* [Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish](http://www.algorithm.com.au/blog/) — BAD
* [Simon Willison’s Weblog](http://simonwillison.net) — BAD

Wow! I'm very surprised! But I'am sure, that you already have a CSS for printer or are planning to add it next week. Am I right? :-)

Anyway, please, support this game and the movement!
