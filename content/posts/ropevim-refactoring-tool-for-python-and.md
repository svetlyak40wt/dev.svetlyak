Description: 

Today I found an interesting project "[rope][1]". It is a python library for refactoring python code. Also, it has frontends for vim and emacs. As I am active user of the vim, I wrote a simple script, to simplify installation and update of the [ropevim][2]. To try ropevim, you need a Vim with support for python plugins and mercurial, to fetch sources of the rope from repository. If you work under Linux Ubuntu, like me, then you need to do few simple commands, to install the ropevim: 

  * First, install the mercurial and vim-python: **sudo apt-get install mercurial vim-python**.
  * Next, create a directory anywhere in your home directory and download [my installation script][3] into that directory.
  * Make script executable and run it.
  * Add one line into your _.vimrc_ to _source_ autogenerated configuration file.

That's it! Enjoy python refactoring with vim and rope. And don't forget [to read a ropevim manual][4] with default keybindings.
