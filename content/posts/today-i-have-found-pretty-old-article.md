Description: 

Today, I have found a pretty old article (from 2003) [about meta classes in the python][1].

I am not be familiar with meta programming in the python, before. But after reading of this article, I understand it very well and recommend to read it, if you still don't know what is the '__metaclass__' keyword for.
