Title: Feeds
Slug: feeds

This site has feed almost for anything. Just try to add a '/rss/' at the end of some URL.

To be more precise, I have a [feed for all posts and links][rss-all], as well, as separate feeds for [text][rss-texts] posts and for [links][rss-links].

Each post's page has it's own rss feed for all comments on this post.

Also, I have separate feeds for each tag or tags combination. For example, you can subscribe to [all links related to python](/links/bytag/python/rss/) or just to [posts about git tips](/blog/bytag/tips+git/rss/).

It's easy, just add these feeds in you favorite RSS reader!

[rss-links]: http://feeds2.feedburner.com/LazyCrazyCoder/links
